		<img src="views/help/SidebarMinimized.jpg" alt="Sidebar Minimized" style="max-height: 200px; max-width: 100px;">
		<br />
		<br />

		now located directly in the upper left corner.

		<img src="views/help/DataDescriptorNew.jpg" alt="data description creation" style="max-height: 1200px; max-width: 800px;">
		<br />
		Next to each label is a tooltip icon that tells you about the field when you click on it.  The first four values
		are required.  For fields that ask for the names of people or organizations, you can either select from one of
		the existing values or you can create your own.  To create a new person or organization, click on the "Add" button
		below the field in which you wanted to be added.  For person, you will see this form:

		<img src="views/help/DDSelectLocations.jpg" alt="select locations" style="max-height: 800px; max-width: 800px;">
		<br />
		There is a lot going on in this form.  At the top of the form are search fields.  We'll cover that in
		another FAQ section.  In the lower half, there are existing metadata records that you can associate
		with your file by clicking "Associate" next to those that apply.   When you are finished, click the
		"Close" button and you will see all the associated records appear in the data descriptor form.

		the metadata for a given file, click on the "Actions" menu next to the file and then click on "View/Add Metadata."
		<br />
		<br />
		After saving your metadata, if you go back to your "My Data" page and look in the "status" column, you

	<button class="accordion">How do I get my file(s) into the repository for group viewing?</button>
	<div class="panel"><br />
		Marking files as "ready for group dissemination" is called "Staging."  This process lets the 
		system administrators know that you have added the necessary metadata and ensured your file
		is ready for group use.  The administrator will verify this and then publish your file to the 
		repository.  To stage multiple files with one action, all files all need to be in the same directory.
		The process is the same regardless of if you are affecting just one file or multiples.
		First, go to the My Data page, then check the box on the left side next to each file 
		you want to stage.  At the top of the files section of the page, click the "Actions" menu to see the following.
		<br />
		<br />
		<img src="views/help/FileGroupActionsDropdown.jpg" alt="file group actions dropdown menu" style="max-height: 300px; max-width: 300px;">
		<br />
		<br />
		Click the "Stage/Unstage For Repository" menu item.  When the page refreshes, all affected files should
		now show as "staged" in the status column. 
		Once the process completes, you should see the status column for each affected file change to include
		the word "Staged."
		<br />
		<br />
		<img src="views/help/Staged.jpg" alt="file is staged status" style="max-height: 200px; max-width: 800px;">
		<br />
		<br />
		When each file is approved by the system administrator, the
		status will change to "published."  Should you later change your mind and decide the file is not ready
		for staging, follow the exact same process to reverse the status and unstage the file.

	<div class="panel"><br />
		The process to un-stage a file is exactly the same as the one you followed to stage it originally.
		To unstage multiple files with one action, all files all need to be in the same directory.
		The process is the same regardless of if you are affecting just one file or multiples.
		First, go to the My Data page, then check the box on the left side next to each file you want to un-stage.  
		At the top of the files section of the page, click the "Actions" menu to see the following.

		<img src="views/help/FileGroupActionsDropdown.jpg" alt="file group actions dropdown menu" style="max-height: 300px; max-width: 300px;">
		<br />
		<br />
		Click the "Stage/Unstage For Repository" menu item.  When the page refreshes, all affected files' 
		status column should now be empty.
