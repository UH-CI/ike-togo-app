		The "My Data" page is where you are taken immediately after logging in.  You can
		also get there by clicking the "My Data" tab in the sidebar on the left hand side.
		This page shows all the data in your home directory.  These are files to which you have

	<button class="accordion">What is "Team Data Preview?"</button>
	<div class="panel"><br />
	    The "Team Data Preview" page is accessed by clicking on the tab of the same name in
	    the sidebar on the left side of the window.  This area allows you to browse and
	    download the files of your team-mates in the `Ike Wai project.  You will not be
	    able to alter the files in this directory, it only allows you to see everyone else's
	    data.

	<div class="panel"><br />
	    "Annotated Team Data" is accessed by clicking on the tab of the same name in
		the sidebar on the left side of the window.  This area holds all data that

		<img src="views/help/SidebarToggle.jpg" alt="Sidebar Toggle Icon" style="max-height: 50px; max-width: 50px;">
		<br />

		At first, the sidebar looks like this:
	    <br />
	    <br />
		<img src="views/help/Sidebar.jpg" alt="Sidebar Full" style="max-height: 200px; max-width: 200px;">
		<br />

	    <br />
		<img src="views/help/SidebarMinimized.jpg" alt="Sidebar Minimized" style="max-height: 200px; max-width: 100px;">
		<br />
		<br />
		If the sidebar is minimized and you want to show it in full again, click the same sidebar icon,
		now located directly in the upper left corner.
		<p />
		Note that the sidebar is automatically hidden when the window is made too small.
		However, when the narrowness of the window triggers this, the sidebar gets moved to
		the top of screen in a minimized state.
	    <br />
	    <br />
		<img src="views/help/SidebarMinimizedTop.jpg" alt="Sidebar Minimized Top" style="max-height: 100px; max-width: 600px;">

		<br />

		Click on the "My Data" tab in the side bar.  This will bring you to the
		"My Data" page.  Click on the "Upload File" button in the upper left corner,
		under the "My Data" header.
		<br />
		<br />
		<img src="views/help/UploadFileButton.jpg" alt="Upload file button" border="1" style="max-height: 100px; max-width: 200px;">
		<!-- <img src="UploadFileButton.jpg" alt="Upload file button" height="50" width="117"> -->
	    <br />
	    <br />
	    This brings up the upload files box:

	    <br />
	    <img src="views/help/UploadFiles.jpg" alt="Upload files window" style="max-height: 400px; max-width: 500px;">

	    <!--<img src="views/help/UploadFiles.jpg" alt="Upload files window" height="28%">-->
	    <br />
	    <br />
	    You can drag your files and folders into this box, or click in the shaded area
	    to bring up your computer's file manager system to select the files to upload.
	    As files are added, you will see them listed:
	    <br />
	    <br />
	    <img src="views/help/UploadFiles2.jpg" alt="Files to upload" style="max-height: 400px; max-width: 500px;">

	    <!-- <img src="views/help/UploadFiles2.jpg" alt="Files to upload" height="35%"> -->
	    <br />
	    <br />
	    Once all your files are included, click the "Upload" button in the bottom right
	    corner of the box and your files will be uploaded to your directory.  Progress for
	    larger files will show a percentage of completion until finished.
	    <br />
			<br />
			For large files or if your internet connection is spotty, consider the alternate method
			of using Globus.  Globus is a very robust data transfer technology that is ideal for 
			moving many GB of data back and forth.  All Ike Wai research gateway users have 
			access to Globus by default.
	    <br />
			<br />
			The first thing you need to do is create a Globus account - you can and should use 
			you university of Hawaii credentials - so go to 
			<a href="https://app.globus.org/signup">the Globus signup</a> and select 
			"University of Hawaii" from the dropdown menu and select "continue".  You will then 
			be taken to the UH gold screen login page where you can use your UH credentials to 
			login.
	    <br />
			<br />
			After you have successfully created and account you next need to download 
			the client software for your laptop/desktop.  Select the appropriate link below
			for the installation directions for your OS.
			<ul>
					<li><a href="https://docs.globus.org/how-to/globus-connect-personal-mac/">mac</a></li>
					<li><a href="https://docs.globus.org/how-to/globus-connect-personal-windows/">windows</a></li>
					<li><a href="https://docs.globus.org/how-to/globus-connect-personal-linux/">linux</a></li>
			</ul>
	    <br />
			Follow the above directions to install and configure the client software 
			to turn your laptop/desktop into a globus data transfer endpoint.
	    <br />
			<br />
			Once that is completed you can follow the  
			<a href="https://docs.globus.org/how-to/get-started/">file transfer instructions</a>.
      The Collection endpoint to 
			transfer files to is IKEWAI the other endpoint to move files from will be the 
			one you created in the above steps.  
	    <br />
			<br />
			If you created your globus account with your UH credentials you won't need to 
			do anything to  login for the IKEWAI collection
	    <br />
			<br />
			Once you have selected the IKEWAI collection endpoint you should see your 
			ike wai mydata storage files.

    To delete multiple files at once, the files all need to be in the same directory.
	  Check the box on the left side next to each file you want to delete.  At the top of
	  the files section of the page, there is an Actions menu.  Click "Actions" to see the menu.

		<br />
		Click on the "Actions" menu to the right of the target file.
		This brings up a dropdown menu with all file actions.
		<br />
		<img src="views/help/FileActionsDropdown.jpg" alt="file actions dropdown menu" style="max-height: 300px; max-width: 300px;">
		<br />
		Click on the "Annotate File" item.  Assuming you have never added any
		metadata to this file, you will see this:
		<br />
		<br />
		<img src="views/help/NoDataDescriptors.jpg" alt="metadata association page with no data descriptors" style="max-height: 700px; max-width: 700px;">
		<br />
		<br />
		At the very top you can see the file that was selected.  If you selected multiple files
		and picked the "Annotate File" items from the group action menu, you would see
		all the chosen files listed there.  Below that is the section that would display any
		data descriptors that are already association with the selected file(s).  Since there 
		aren't any associations yet, it states there are no data descriptors for this file.
		The final section shows existing data descriptors that you can clone (and edit) or 
		just associate directly with your file(s).
		<br />
		<br />
		A data descriptor is a basic description of your data.  The intent is to provide
		the bare minimum level of information that would allow other researchers to 
		find, understand, and trust your data. 
		<br />
		<br />
		A file can have multiple data descriptors,
		and each data descriptor can be associated with multiple files.  For example, 
		say you did a well sampling trip, and each well result was a separate file.  
		You might have one overall data descriptor that you associate with all the files, 
		indicating the date(s) of the trip, the island, who took the samples, or anything else
		that applies to all the data.  Then you might make different data descriptors
		for each location describing the time of the sample, who was involved at that 
		particular location, what was collected, the importance of that location,
		or whatever else is unique to that set of files.
		<br />
		<br />
		To create a new data descriptor for your data, click the "Create New Data Descriptor" button. 
		<br />
		<br />
		<img src="views/help/DataDescriptorNewV2.jpg" alt="data description creation" style="max-height: 1200px; max-width: 800px;">
		<br />
		<br />
		Next to each label is a tooltip icon that tells you about the field when you click on it.  The first four values
		are required.  For fields that ask for the names of people or organizations, you can either select from one of
		the existing values or you can create your own.  To create a new person or organization, click on the "Add" button
		below the field in which you wanted to be added.  For person, you will see this form:
		<br />
		<br />
		<img src="views/help/CreatePerson.jpg" alt="person creation" style="max-height: 600px; max-width: 600px;">
		<br />
		<br />
		For organization, you will see this form:
		<br />
		<br />
		<img src="views/help/CreateOrganization.jpg" alt="org creation" style="max-height: 600px; max-width: 600px;">
		<br />
		<br />
		Add some values to the form and click save.  The new record shows up as selected in
		your form.  You can remove any entries by clicking the "x" button next to the entry you want to remove.
		<br />
		<br />
		<img src="views/help/DDCreatorAdded.jpg" alt="creator added" style="max-height: 100px; max-width: 400px;">
		<br />
		<br />
		When you are finished, click the "Save Data Descriptor" button at the bottom 
		of the form.  The form will show a message that your data descriptor metadata 
		has been saved and the new data descriptor will be shown as being associated
		with your file:
		<br />
		<br />
		<img src="views/help/DDSavedView.jpg" alt="data descriptor saved view" style="max-height: 800px; max-width: 800px;">
		<br />
		<br />
		If you need to change any of the values after this, click the "Edit" button next
		to your Data Descriptor.  This will reload the form you just filled in, 
		pre-loaded with all your values.  
		<br />
		<br />
		<img src="views/help/DDEdit.jpg" alt="data descriptor edit view" style="max-height: 1200px; max-width: 800px;">
		<br />
		<br />
		Note that there are some new additions to the form that you didn't see when
		you first created your Data Descriptor:  "Select Locations" and "Select Variables".
		This is because the Data Descriptor needs to exist in the system before
		other types of metadata can be associated with it.
		<br />
		<br />
		To add existing Location or Variable metadata to your file, click on the 
		"Select Locations" or "Select Variables" buttons in the Data Descriptor form.  
		In each case, you will see something similar to this.
		<br />
		<br />
		<img src="views/help/DDSelectLocations.jpg" alt="select locations" style="max-height: 800px; max-width: 800px;">
		<br />
		<br />
		At the top of the form are search fields. In the lower half, there are existing 
		locations that you can associate with your file by clicking "Associate" 
		next to those that apply.   When you are finished, click the "Close" button and 
		you will see all the associated records appear in the data descriptor form.
		<br />
		<br />
		<img src="views/help/DDLocations.jpg" alt="locations selected" style="max-height: 300px; max-width: 400px;">
		<br />
		<br />
		After saving your metadata, if you go back to your "My Data" page and look in the "status" column, you
		will see the word "annotated" there.
		<br />
		<br />
		<img src="views/help/Annotated.jpg" alt="file is annotated status" style="max-height: 200px; max-width: 800px;">
		<br />
		<br />
		If you later decide other files should be associated with an existing data descriptor,
		select the "Annotate File" item from the Actions menu next to the file, then
		look through the Data Descriptors that are displayed at the bottom of the resulting
		page.  You can either make a copy of any of the data descriptors, or you can 
		click the "Associate" button next to one or more data descriptors.

	<button class="accordion">How do I get my file(s) into the repository for group viewing?</button>
	<div class="panel"><br />
		Marking files as "ready for group dissemination" is called "Staging."  This process lets the 
		system administrators know that you have added the necessary metadata and ensured your file
		is ready for group use.  The administrator will verify this and then publish your file to the 
		repository.  
		
		First, go to the My Data page.  If you only want to stage one file, click the "Stage/Unstage"
		menu item from the file's Actions menu on the right.   

		To stage multiple files with one action, all files all need to be in the same directory.
		Check the box on the left side next to each file 
		you want to stage.  At the top of the files section of the page, click the "Actions" menu to see the following.
		<br />
		<br />
		<img src="views/help/FileGroupActionsDropdown.jpg" alt="file group actions dropdown menu" style="max-height: 300px; max-width: 300px;">
		<br />
		<br />
		Click the "Stage/Unstage For Repository" menu item.  When the page refreshes, all affected files should
		now show as "staged" in the status column. 
		Once the process completes, you should see the status column for each affected file change to include
		the word "Staged."
		<br />
		<br />
		<img src="views/help/Staged.jpg" alt="file is staged status" style="max-height: 200px; max-width: 800px;">
		<br />
		<br />
		When each file is approved by the system administrator, the
		status will change to "published."  Should you later change your mind and decide the file is not ready
		for staging, follow the exact same process to reverse the status and unstage the file.
	</div>


	<button class="accordion">How do I "un-stage" my file(s) from the repository for group viewing?</button>
	<div class="panel"><br />
		The process to un-stage a file is exactly the same as the one you followed to stage it originally.
		To unstage multiple files with one action, all files all need to be in the same directory.
		First, go to the My Data page.  If you only want to un-stage one file, click the "Stage/Unstage"
		menu item from the file's Actions menu on the right.  For multiple files, 
		check the box on the left side next to each file you want to un-stage.  
		At the top of the files section of the page, click the "Actions" menu to see the following.
		<br />
		<br />
		<img src="views/help/FileGroupActionsDropdown.jpg" alt="file group actions dropdown menu" style="max-height: 300px; max-width: 300px;">
		<br />
		<br />
		Click the "Stage/Unstage For Repository" menu item.  When the page refreshes, all affected files' 
		status column should now be empty.
	</div>



	<button class="accordion">How do I share my files with people who are not in the group?</button>
	<div class="panel"><br />
		To share your file with someone who does not have access to the system,
		you can generate a "Share Link" which will allow them to download the file
		without requiring any form of login.  To do this, go to the "My Data" page.
		Click the "Actions" menu next to the file you want to share and select 
		"Create Share Link."  This modal will appear:
		<br />
		<br />
		<img src="views/help/CreateShareLink.jpg" alt="create url to share file with others" style="max-height: 600px; max-width: 600px;">
		<br />
		<br />
		The modal allows you to set the number of times the file can be downloaded and 
		also lets you set an expiration date.  Once you set those, click the "Save"
		button and the window changes to:
		<br />
		<br />
		<img src="views/help/CreateShareLinkSaved.jpg" alt="save url to share file with others" style="max-height: 600px; max-width: 600px;">
		<br />
		<br />
		You can use the buttons at the bottom to either email it to someone, or copy 
		it to your clip board for however you want to use it.
		<br />
		<br />
		To see all your share links, click on the "Share Links" tab in the sidebar.
		<br />
		<br />
		<img src="views/help/ShareLinks.jpg" alt="show and manage all share links" style="max-height: 400px; max-width: 800px;">
		<br />
		<br />
		All currently active share links will be listed here.  You can use the items
		in the "Actions" menu next to each share link to email, copy, or delete each
		share link.

	<button class="accordion">How do I make my files and metadata publically available?</button>
	<div class="panel"><br />
		The Gateway also has the ability to push your files and associated data descriptor to Hydroshare
		or the Ikewai.org site.  Ikewai.org is the public dissemination platform for all project 
		created data.  It is entirely up to the researcher as to when their data will be displayed there.
		However, note that if the researcher pushes their data to Hydroshare, it will also automatically
		be pushed to the ikewai.org site.  Note that the ability to push to ikewai.org or Hydroshare
		is not available until after the files have been in the Gateway's annotated repository.  The 
		menu items discussed here will not appear until then.
		<br />
		<br />
		To push to Ikewai.org or Hydroshare, go to your Data Descriptors page by clicking on the
		"Data Descriptors" menu item on the left side of the screen.  This displays two sub-menu 
		items "All Data Descriptors" and "My Data Descriptors."  Click on the "My Data Descriptors"
		menu item.  This loads a page that shows all data descriptors created by you.
		<br />
		<br />
		<img src="views/help/walkthrough/MyDataDescriptorsPage.jpg" alt="listing of all of the current users data descriptors" style="max-height: 700px; max-width: 900px;">
		<br />
		<br />
		Next to each data descriptor is an "Action" menu.  Clicking on it shows:
		<br />
		<br />
		<img src="views/help/walkthrough/MyDataDescriptorsMenuStage.jpg" alt="actions menu for data descriptors" style="max-height: 300px; max-width: 300px;">
		<br />
		<br />
		If you were to click on the "Stage to Ikewai" menu, a modified version of the "View 
		Data Descriptor" page appears.  This page shows all the information on the data descriptor,
		along with the files associated with that data descriptor.  It also has a button, "Stage to Ikewai"
		along with some explanatory text about what this means.
		<br />
		<br />
		<img src="views/help/walkthrough/StageToIkewai.jpg" alt="view of the data descriptor when staging to ikewai.org" style="max-height: 700px; max-width: 800px;">
		<br />
		<br />
		When that button is clicked, it notifies the Gateway administrators that you are ready to have
		your data appear on the ikewai.org site.  The administrator will confirm the action and push the 
		data descriptor and all associated files to the ikewai.org site where it will then be available
		to anyone, no log in required.  Until the administrators do the push, you will see a new tag 
		next to your relevant files that now says "Staged to ikewai.org."  After the administrators 
		do the push, the tag will change to "Pushed to ikewai.org."
		<br />
		<br />
		If instead, you clicked the "Stage to Hydroshare" button, the same page that shows the data descriptor
		and file information will appear, but this time the button will say "Stage to Hydroshare."  
		Before clicking this button, make sure to review your data descriptor to verify that everything is as 
		you want it, particularly the license that you have selected.  Once your data is pushed to Hydroshare
		and a DOI is obtained, the information cannot be changed.
		<br />
		<br />
		Note that there is a secondary effect of the
		stage to Hydroshare, each of the associated files will be given a public URL which will enable
		those who do not have access to the gateway to retrieve the files.  If you were to click on your 
		pushed Data Descriptor after having pushed it, you will see new URLs for each file at the top,
		labelled "Public File Links."
		<br />
		<br />
		<img src="views/help/walkthrough/StagedToHydroshareDataDescriptor.jpg" alt="view of the data descriptor after staging to Hydroshare" style="max-height: 700px; max-width: 800px;">
		<br />
		<br />
		Upon clicking the "Stage to Hydroshare" button, Gateway administrators are notified and will review 
		the submission and do the actual push to Hydroshare.  Once that is done, the "Staged to Hydroshare"
		tag next to your relevant files will change to "Pushed to Hydroshare."  Also, one more new URL 
		will be added to the top of your data descriptor, the "Hydroshare Resource URL."  This is a unique
		link to your resource at Hydroshare.
		<br />
		<br />
		Unfortunately, Hydroshare does not allow the obtaining of DOIs through their API, so the Gateway 
		administrators need to log in to the Hydroshare site and request the DOI manually.  Once it is issued,
		the Gateway will be updated and the new DOI url will also be added to the Data Descriptor.  In the 
		meantime, the Hydroshare resource URL mentioned above can be used to see what your DOI link will be, 
		should you need it for a publication.
