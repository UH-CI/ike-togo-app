<h3>Admin Walkthrough</h3>


This will take you through the actions of an Admin of the `Ike Wai gateway.
<p>
  While this page gives an overview of all the Admin features, please do NOT touch 
  anything on the apps or systems pages without extreme caution as a mistake there can 
  cause the Gateway to cease funtioning correctly.
</p>

<p />
To start, you go to <a href="http://ikewai.its.hawaii.edu">`Ike ToGo</a>.

<br /><br />
<img src="views/help/Login1.jpg" alt="Enter your username and password" style="max-height: 300px; max-width: 300px;">
<br /><br />
Enter your UH username and password here and click the 'Login' button.
After logging in, you will be taken to the "My Data" page:
<br /><br />
<img src="views/help/walkthrough/MyDataEmpty.jpg" alt="My Data page screenshot" style="max-height: 400px; max-width: 600px;">
<br /><br />
<p />
Notice the sidebar on the left hand side of the screen.
<br />
<br />
<img src="views/help/Sidebar.jpg" alt="Sidebar Full" style="max-height: 400px; max-width: 200px;">
<br />
<br />
This is the primary means of navigating the site.  
The main tabs are: Data, Data Descriptors, Share Links, Search, and Help.  
You may notice that the sidebar screenshot includes a final item, "Admin," 
this is only for the site administrators.  This is where we will be focusing most of our efforts.
<br />
<br />
<img src="views/help/AdminMenu.jpg" alt="Admin Menu" style="max-height: 400px; max-width: 200px;">
<br />
<br />
The first menu item is "Staged Files."  When users mark their files as ready to be pushed to the 
Gateway's annotated repository, they are said to be "staged."  This page shows all staged files 
so the Admin's can go through them, verify that they are appropriately annotated, and either 
approve the file or reject it.  If approved, the file will appear in the annotated repository and
will appear as a result of relevant searches in the Gateway.  If the file is rejected, the Admin
will need to provide guidance to the user as to what actions need to be taken.  This is then
emailed to the user letting them know the status of their file.
<br /><br />
<img src="views/help/AdminStagedFiles.jpg" alt="Staged File Page" style="max-height: 600px; max-width: 800px;">
<br /><br />
<p />
<p>
  The next item is "Unapproved Metadata."  I honestly can't recall what this is for.  Just ignore it for now.
</p>

"Manage Metadata" allows administrators to create and edit the various Metadata
records created for the Gateway.  This is not the same as annotations, instead these are
collections of fields describing people or objects: wells, sites, variables, people, water
quality sites, and timeseries.  These metadata objects are frequently included as part of 
the Gateway users' annotation process.
<p />
Note that the page will initially be empty of records, you need to do a search first.  You can 
just hit the search button without entering or selecting anything, but more likely, you will 
want to narrow down the results as you are looking for something specific.
<p>
  Once you find a metadata record you want to edit, click the "edit" button at the end of the 
  row to see a pop-up window with all the available fields for that item.
</p>
<br /><br />

<br /><br />
<p />
<p>
  "Impersonate" is a means by which a user can change their account to impersonate another user.
  The developers of the Gateway use this feature for testing and for researching issues any individual
  user has reported.  The use of this feature requires a development environment set up on your computer,
  so if you are not a developer, this feature will not work for you and you can ignore it.
</p>
<br /><br />
<img src="views/help/AdminImpersonate.jpg" alt="Impersonate User Page" style="max-height: 600px; max-width: 800px;">
<br /><br />
<p />
<p>
  "Apps" are wrappers for scripts and workflows that allow Gateway users to run jobs on the HPC.
  These apps are usually created at a user's request by the developers and will only appear on the 
  Jobs page of the user who requested it.  This page allows the admins to define and edit apps.
  Please don't edit anything unless you are absolutely sure of what you are doing and have the permission
  of the affected user(s).
</p>
<br /><br />
<img src="views/help/AdminApps.jpg" alt="Manage Apps Page" style="max-height: 600px; max-width: 800px;">
<br /><br />
<p />
<p>
  "Systems" are the definitions of connections to storage and computer systems.  Please don't 
  edit anything here unless you really know what you are doing as a single typo can make it so 
  users won't be able to reach their files or run things on the HPC.
</p>
<br /><br />
<img src="views/help/AdminSystems.jpg" alt="Manage Systems Page" style="max-height: 600px; max-width: 800px;">
<br /><br />
<p />
<p>
I don't really remember what the "Notifications" page is for.  Feel free to ignore it.  
</p>
<br /><br />
<img src="views/help/AdminNotifications.jpg" alt="Manage Notifications Page" style="max-height: 600px; max-width: 800px;">
<br /><br />
<p />
<hr />
<p>
  While this ends the "Admin menu" section of the walkthrough, there is one more admin feature 
  that allows admins to create and edit annotations for other users and to stage their
  data to the annotated repository.
</p>
<p>
  Click on the "Team Data Preview" menu item under "My Data" and then
  browse to the data folder of the user whose data you are going to annotate or stage. 
</p>
<br /><br />
<img src="views/help/AdminTeamDataPreview.jpg" alt="Admin View of Team Data Preview" style="max-height: 800px; max-width: 1000px;">
<br /><br />
<p />
<p>
  In this case, I'm using the data folder of "omeier," a test user.  
  Notice the "Actions" menu that is opened up to the right of the "Notes_Anchialine_Ponds.pdf" 
  file.  A non-admin user would only see the items "Download" and "Preview."  Admin users
  also see "Annotate File" and "Stage/Unstage to Repository."  This is how an admin can 
  annotate and stage files belonging to another user.  
</p>
<p>
  The annotation and staging process from 
  this point forward works exactly as it does for a non-admin user doing these steps on their own files.
  Please refer to the non-admin <a href="#/help">help documentation</a> for further instruction if needed.
