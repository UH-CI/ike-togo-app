<h3>Walkthrough</h3>


This will take you through the "typical" process of using the `Ike ToGo system.  This 
is written from the viewpoint of a brand-new user who has never logged in to the sytem
who wants to log in, upload data, create a directory structure, move data around, and 
see the data of their `Ike Wai team-mates.

To start, you go to <a href="http://ikewai.its.hawaii.edu">`Ike ToGo</a>.  
You may see briefly see this page: 
<br />
<img src="views/help/Login1.jpg" alt="Wait to be forwarded" style="max-height: 200px; max-width: 200px;">
<br />
If you do see it, wait a moment and you will be brought to the login page:
<br />
<img src="views/help/Login3.jpg" alt="Enter your username and password" style="max-height: 300px; max-width: 300px;">
<br />
Enter your UH username and password here and click the 'Sign in' button.
After logging in, you will be taken to the "My Data" page:
<br />
<img src="views/help/walkthrough/MyDataEmpty.jpg" alt="My Data page screenshot" style="max-height: 400px; max-width: 600px;">
<br />
The "My Data" page is where all your personal data will be stored.  It is essentially your
"home directory" in the `Ike ToGo system.  All files uploaded to here are under your control.
You will be able to copy, move, rename, delete, and download all files you place here.
Please note that your `Ike Wai team-mates will be able to view anything you upload, but they
will not be able to do anything with it other than download.
<p />
In the case of a research group, at your request, we can set up the My Data section to give
all members of your group equal access, so this would become a shared directory for all in
your group and all members would have equal permissions on all files, regardless of which 
member of the group uploaded the data.  So in this situation, although you uploaded a file,
another member of your group could rename, move, or even delete the file.
<p />
Going over the page itself, notice the sidebar on the left hand side of the screen.
<br />
<img src="views/help/Sidebar.jpg" alt="Sidebar Full" style="max-height: 200px; max-width: 200px;">
<br />
This is
the primary means of navigating the site.  The "Team Data Preview" tab will take you to an
area where you can see, but not modify, all the data uploaded by other members of the `Ike Wai team.
The "My Data" tab will return you to your home directory in the system, and the "Help" tab will 
take you to the help pages.  If you need to conserve real-estate and would like to hide the sidebar,
click the little icon that looks like 4 horizontal lines.  For more about the sidebar see      
<a href="#/help/#sidebar">this section</a> of the FAQ.  For the rest of the walkthrough, to
save screen space, the spacebar will be minimized so it will not be included in the
screen shots.

<p />
When you first log in, it is completely empty, so your first act is to upload some data.
Click on the "upload" button in the top left corner of the page, under the "My Data" header.
<br />
<br />
<img src="views/help/UploadFileButton.jpg" alt="Upload file button" border="1" style="max-height: 100px; max-width: 200px;">
<br />
<br />
This brings up the upload files box:
<br />
<br />
<img src="views/help/UploadFiles.jpg" alt="Upload files window" style="max-height: 400px; max-width: 500px;">
<br />
<br />
Drag your files and folders into this box, or click in the shaded area
to bring up your computer's file manager system to select the files to upload.
As files are added, you will see them listed:
<br />
<br />
<img src="views/help/walkthrough/UploadMultipleFiles.jpg" alt="Files to upload" style="max-height: 500px; max-width: 500px;">
<br />
<br />
Once all your files are included, click the "Upload" button in the bottom right 
corner of the box and your files will be uploaded to your directory.  Progress for
larger files will show a percentage of completion until finished.  Once the upload is complete,
the upload window goes away and you can see your data in your directory.
<br />
<br />
<img src="views/help/walkthrough/MyDataPostUpload.jpg" alt="My Data after upload" style="max-height: 600px; max-width: 600px;">
<br />
<br />
Once you have data in your home directory, if it wasn't uploaded with any folder structure,
you may want to create some.  To create a directory, click on the "Create" button that
is located next to the "Upload" button you used earlier.
<br />
<br />
<img src="views/help/UploadFileButton.jpg" alt="Upload file button" border="1" style="max-height: 100px; max-width: 200px;">
<br />
<br />
This will bring up the following box in which you enter the name of the new folder,
named "Metadata," and click the "Create" button.
<br />
<br />
<img src="views/help/walkthrough/CreateFolderNamedMetadata.jpg" alt="Create folder enter name" style="max-height: 400px; max-width: 600px;">
<br />
<br />
The folder now appears in your home directory.
<br />
<br />
<img src="views/help/walkthrough/MyDataPostFolderCreate.jpg" alt="My Data showing folder created" style="max-height: 400px; max-width: 600px;">
<br />
<br />
Next, you move some of your files to the new directory.  First, check the box to the left
of all the files to be moved.
<br />
<br />
<img src="views/help/walkthrough/CheckFilesToMove.jpg" alt="My Data showing selected files" style="max-height: 400px; max-width: 600px;">
<br />
<br />
After you have selected your files to be moved in to your new directory, click the "Actions"
menu button at the top left of the files area.  This shows a dropdown menu of all actions
that can be done on multiple files.
<br />
<br />
<img src="views/help/walkthrough/MultipleFileMenu.jpg" alt="dropdown menu for multiple files" style="max-height: 400px; max-width: 600px;">
<br />
<br />
Click the "Move" item in the menu and it brings up a dialog in which you will select the
new location for the selected files.
<br />
<br />
<img src="views/help/walkthrough/MoveMultipleFilesDialog1.jpg" alt="multiple files move dialog" style="max-height: 400px; max-width: 600px;">
<br />
<br />
This confirms the files you are moving, but you need to tell the system to where it should
move the files. Click the "Select New Location" button and it brings up a window showing
you any directories in your current directory.
<br />
<br />
<img src="views/help/walkthrough/MoveFilesSelectDestination1.jpg" alt="multiple files move select destination dialog" style="max-height: 400px; max-width: 600px;">
<br />
<br />
Click on the "Metadata" directory.
<br />
<br />
<img src="views/help/walkthrough/MoveFilesSelectDestination2.jpg" alt="multiple files move select destination dialog" style="max-height: 400px; max-width: 600px;">
<br />
<br />
Notice that the metadata directory shows up in a different location and that there are
no sub-directories shown as it has none.  
Click "Use Selected location" and it will close the location selection dialog and you 
see the Move dialog again, now showing the new destination for your files.
<br />
<br />
<img src="views/help/walkthrough/MoveMultipleFilesDialog2.jpg" alt="multiple files move dialog" style="max-height: 400px; max-width: 600px;">
<br />
<br />
Click the "Move" button and the move takes place, the dialog goes away and you can see the
changes in your directory.
<br />
<br />
<img src="views/help/walkthrough/MyDataPostMove1.jpg" alt="My Data post-move" style="max-height: 400px; max-width: 600px;">
<br />
<br />
Click on the metadata directory to see the moved files.
<br />
<br />
<img src="views/help/walkthrough/MyDataPostMove2.jpg" alt="My Data post-move metadata dir" style="max-height: 400px; max-width: 600px;">
<br />
<br />
If, instead, you wanted to move a single file, you could click on the "Actions" button
to the right in the same row as the file you want to move.  A dropdown menu appears from which you
can select the "Move" item and then follow the same process as above.
<br />
<br />
<img src="views/help/FileActionsDropdown.jpg" alt="File actions dropdown menu" style="max-height: 200px; max-width: 400px;">
<br />
<br />
Note the other actions available on this menu: Rename, Copy, Download, and Delete.
<ul>
	<li>Rename: pops up a dialog into which you can enter a new name for the file.</li>
	<li>Copy: opens a dialog that acts the same as the Move process, but it includes a field
	in which you can enter a new name for the copied file.  This allows you to make the copy 
	in the same directory if you want, although you can also save the copy in a different
	directory if you choose.</li>
	<li>Download: a single action that automatically downloads the file to your computer.</li>
	<li>Delete: provides an "are you sure" prompt which then deletes the file if you reply in the affirmative.</li>
</ul>
<p />
After uploading and arranging your data, you may want to see what your team-mates have been
doing.  So open the sidebar and click "Team Data Preview."
<br />
<br />
<img src="views/help/walkthrough/TeamDataPreview.jpg" alt="Team Data Preview" style="max-height: 400px; max-width: 600px;">
<br />
<br />
While in this screenshot you see all members of the CyberInfrastructure team, you will
instead see all members of the `Ike Wai team.  For the purposes of this example, we'll
go with what we see here.  If you click on your own name, you will essentially be back in
your "My Data" directory again.  If instead, you click on anyone else's name, you will
be able to see their data.  You won't be able to do anything with it other than download it.
For this example, if you clicked on "seanbc," you would see the following.
<br />
<br />
<img src="views/help/walkthrough/TeamDataSean.jpg" alt="Team Data Preview Seans Dir" style="max-height: 400px; max-width: 600px;">
<br />
<br />
Notice the path and button at the top of the file section, just under the "Team Data Preview"
header.
<br />
<br />
<img src="views/help/walkthrough/BackUpButton.jpg" alt="Back up button" style="max-height: 100px; max-width: 200px;">
<br />
<br />
The path shows the name of the user whose directory you are looking at.  The little
arrow button next to the name allows you to go back up to the main directory where
you can choose to explore other directories.
