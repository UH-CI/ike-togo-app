<h3>Walkthrough</h3>


This will take you through the "typical" process of using the `Ike ToGo system.  This
is written from the viewpoint of a brand-new user who has never logged in to the sytem
who wants to log in, upload data, create a directory structure, move data around, and
see the data of their `Ike Wai team-mates.
<p />
Please note that this is supported on Chrome and Firefox.  Safari has
known issues, so it is not recommended.
<p />
To start, you go to <a href="http://ikewai.its.hawaii.edu">`Ike ToGo</a>.

<br /><br />
<img src="views/help/Login1.jpg" alt="Enter your username and password" style="max-height: 300px; max-width: 300px;">
<br /><br />
Enter your UH username and password here and click the 'Login' button.
After logging in, you will be taken to the "My Data" page:
<br /><br />
<img src="views/help/walkthrough/MyDataEmpty.jpg" alt="My Data page screenshot" style="max-height: 400px; max-width: 600px;">
<br /><br />

The "My Data" page is where all your personal data will be stored.  It is essentially your
"home directory" in the `Ike ToGo system.  All files uploaded to here are under your control.
You will be able to copy, move, rename, delete, and download all files you place here.
Please note that your `Ike Wai team-mates will be able to view anything you upload, but they
will not be able to do anything with it other than download.
<p />
In the case of a research group, at your request, we can set up the My Data section to give
all members of your group equal access, so this would become a shared directory for all in
your group and all members would have equal permissions on all files, regardless of which
member of the group uploaded the data.  So in this situation, although you uploaded a file,
another member of your group could rename, move, or even delete the file.
<p />
Going over the page itself, notice the sidebar on the left hand side of the screen.

<br />
<br />
<img src="views/help/Sidebar.jpg" alt="Sidebar Full" style="max-height: 400px; max-width: 200px;">
<br />
<br />

This is the primary means of navigating the site.  
The main tabs are: Data, Data Descriptors, Share Links, Search, and Help.  
You may notice that the sidebar screenshot includes a final item, "Admin," 
this is only for the site administrators.  Some of these main tabs have 
sub-tabs.  Here is a brief discussion of each tab and sub-tab.  Each of
these will be discussed in further detail later in this walkthrough.
<ul>
	<li>Data:
		<ul>
			<li>My Data: your home directory.</li>
			<li>Team Data Preview: everyone's home directories, allowing you to see, 
				but not modify, what your team members are working on.</li>
			<li>Annotated Team Data: all annotated and "published" files, meaning
					the owner/author of the data indicated the data is in a good state for others to use.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Data Descriptors: all existing Data Descriptors. A Data Descriptor is a 
		  general set of fields that you fill out about your file/data to assist others
			who may be interested in using that data.</li>
	<li>Share Links: all share links that you currently have.  A share link 
		  is a url that you can email someone giving them access to a specific file</li>
	<li>Search: Has three sub-tabs allowing you to search the Annotated team data in different ways.</li>
	<li>Help: takes you to these help pages.</li>
</ul>

<br />
If you need to conserve real-estate and would like to hide the sidebar,
click the little icon that looks like 4 horizontal lines.  For more about the 
sidebar see "how do show/hide the sidebar" question of the 
<a href="#/help/#sidebar">FAQ</a>.  For the rest of the walkthrough, to
save screen space, the sidebar will be minimized so it will not be included in the
screen shots.
<p />
When you first log in, it is completely empty, so your first act is to upload some data.
Click on the "upload file" button in the top left corner of the page, under the "My Data" header.
<br />
<br />
<img src="views/help/UploadFileButton.jpg" alt="Upload file button" border="1" style="max-height: 100px; max-width: 200px;">
<br />
<br />
This brings up the upload files box:
<br />
<br />
<img src="views/help/UploadFiles.jpg" alt="Upload files window" style="max-height: 400px; max-width: 500px;">
<br />
<br />
Drag your files and folders into this box, or click in the shaded area
to bring up your computer's file manager system to select the files to upload.
As files are added, you will see them listed:
<br />
<br />
<img src="views/help/walkthrough/UploadMultipleFiles.jpg" alt="Files to upload" style="max-height: 500px; max-width: 500px;">
<br />
<br />
Once all your files are included, click the "Upload" button in the bottom right
corner of the box and your files will be uploaded to your directory.  Progress for
larger files will show a percentage of completion until finished.  Once the upload is complete,
the upload window goes away and you can see your data in your directory.
<br />
<br />
<img src="views/help/walkthrough/MyDataPostUpload.jpg" alt="My Data after upload" style="max-height: 600px; max-width: 600px;">
<br />
<br />
One thing to note in this image is the "Size" column.  This column may not be visible to 
you on you screen depending on how big you make your browser window.  In fact, due to the 
current size of this browser window, there are additional columns that are not being shown:
"Last Modified" and "Status," which indicates if the file has been published or not.
<br />
<br />   
Once you have data in your home directory, if it wasn't uploaded with any folder structure,
you may want to create some.  To create a directory, click on the "Create" button that
is located next to the "Upload" button you used earlier.
<br />
<br />
<img src="views/help/UploadFileButton.jpg" alt="Upload file button" border="1" style="max-height: 100px; max-width: 200px;">
<br />
<br />
This will bring up the following box in which you enter the name you want for 
the new folder, for this example, it's named "Metadata," and click the "Create" button.
<br />
<br />
<img src="views/help/walkthrough/CreateFolderNamedMetadata.jpg" alt="Create folder enter name" style="max-height: 400px; max-width: 600px;">
<br />
<br />
The folder now appears in your home directory.
<br />
<br />
<img src="views/help/walkthrough/MyDataPostFolderCreate.jpg" alt="My Data showing folder created" style="max-height: 400px; max-width: 600px;">
<br />
<br />
Next, you move some of your files to the new directory.  First, check the box to the left
of all the files to be moved.
<br />
<br />
<img src="views/help/walkthrough/CheckFilesToMove.jpg" alt="My Data showing selected files" style="max-height: 400px; max-width: 600px;">
<br />
<br />
After you have selected your files to be moved in to your new directory, click the "Actions"
menu button at the top left of the files area.  This shows a dropdown menu of all actions
that can be done on multiple files.  All these actions will be covered later in  this document.
<br />
<br />
<img src="views/help/FileGroupActionsDropdown.jpg" alt="dropdown menu for multiple files" style="max-height: 300px; max-width: 300px;">
<br />
<br />
Click the "Move" item in the menu and it brings up a dialog in which you will select the
new location for the selected files.
<br />
<br />
<img src="views/help/walkthrough/MoveMultipleFilesDialog1.jpg" alt="multiple files move dialog" style="max-height: 400px; max-width: 600px;">
<br />
<br />
This confirms the files you are moving, but you need to tell the system to where it should
move the files. Click the "Select New Location" button and it brings up a window showing
you any directories in your current directory.
<br />
<br />
<img src="views/help/walkthrough/MoveFilesSelectDestination1.jpg" alt="multiple files move select destination dialog" style="max-height: 400px; max-width: 600px;">
<br />
<br />
Click on the "Metadata" directory.
<br />
<br />
<img src="views/help/walkthrough/MoveFilesSelectDestination2.jpg" alt="multiple files move select destination dialog" style="max-height: 400px; max-width: 600px;">
<br />
<br />
Notice that the metadata directory shows up in a different location and that there are
no sub-directories shown as it has none.
Click "Use Selected location" and it will close the location selection dialog and you
see the Move dialog again, now showing the new destination for your files.
<br />
<br />
<img src="views/help/walkthrough/MoveMultipleFilesDialog2.jpg" alt="multiple files move dialog" style="max-height: 400px; max-width: 600px;">
<br />
<br />
Click the "Move" button and the move takes place, the dialog goes away and you can see the
changes in your directory.
<br />
<br />
<img src="views/help/walkthrough/MyDataPostMove1.jpg" alt="My Data post-move" style="max-height: 400px; max-width: 600px;">
<br />
<br />
Click on the metadata directory to see the moved files.
<br />
<br />
<img src="views/help/walkthrough/MyDataPostMove2.jpg" alt="My Data post-move metadata dir" style="max-height: 400px; max-width: 600px;">
<br />
<br />
To return back to your home directory, either click the "My Data" tab, or click on 
your name in the breadcrumbs, located directly between the "Create folder" button 
and the "Actions" menu:
<br />
<br />
<img src="views/help/walkthrough/Breadcrumbs.jpg" alt="Navigation breadcrumbs" style="max-height: 100px; max-width: 300px;">
<br />
<br />
If, instead, you wanted to move a single file, click on the "Actions" button
to the right in the same row as the file you want to move.  A dropdown menu 
appears from which you can select the "Move" item and then follow the same 
process as above.
<br />
<br />
<img src="views/help/FileActionsDropdown.jpg" alt="File actions dropdown menu" style="max-height: 300px; max-width: 300px;">
<br />
<br />
Note the other actions available on this menu: Manage Annotations, Rename, 
Copy, Move, Download, Create Share Link, and Delete.
<ul>
	<li>Manage Annotations: create/remove associations between the file and metadata, for now, data descriptors.
	<li>Rename: opens a dialog into which you can enter a new name for the file.</li>
	<li>Copy: opens a dialog that acts the same as the Move process, but it includes a field
	in which you can enter a new name for the copied file.  This allows you to make the copy
	in the same directory if you want, although you can also save the copy in a different
	directory if you choose.</li>
	<li>Move: opens a dialog that allows you to move the file to a new location.</li>
	<li>Download: a single action that automatically downloads the file to your computer.</li>
	<li>Create Share Link: generates a url that you can email someone giving them 
			access to the file, regardless of their group or UH affiliations.</li>
	<li>Delete: provides an "are you sure" prompt which then deletes the file if you reply in the affirmative.</li>
</ul>
<p />
After uploading and arranging your data, you may want to see what your team-mates have been
doing.  So open the sidebar and click "Team Data Preview" under the "Data" tab.
<br />
<br />
<img src="views/help/walkthrough/TeamDataPreview.jpg" alt="Team Data Preview" style="max-height: 400px; max-width: 600px;">
<br />
<br />
While in this screenshot you see all members of the CyberInfrastructure team, you will
instead see all members of the `Ike Wai team.  For the purposes of this example, we'll
go with what we see here.  If you click on anyone's name, you will
be able to see their data.  You won't be able to do anything with it other than download it.
For this example, if you clicked on "seanbc," you would see the following.
<br />
<br />
<img src="views/help/walkthrough/TeamDataSean.jpg" alt="Team Data Preview Seans Dir" style="max-height: 400px; max-width: 600px;">
<br />
<br />
Notice the path and button at the top of the file section, just under the "Team Data Preview"
header.
<br />
<br />
<img src="views/help/walkthrough/BackUpButton.jpg" alt="Back up button" style="max-height: 100px; max-width: 200px;">
<br />
<br />
The path shows the name of the user whose directory you are looking at.  The little
arrow button next to the name allows you to go back up to the main directory where
you can choose to explore other directories.  Please note that even if you click on 
your own name on the "Team Data Preview" page, you will still only have read access. 
To make changes to your own files, you need to go back to your "My Data" page.
<br />
<br />
After uploading some data and getting comfortable with the file management interface, 
it's time to start adding metadata to your files.  Go back to the "My Data" page
by clicking on the "My Data" sidebar item.  Click on the "Actions" menu 
to the right of one of your files.  Then click on the "Manage Annotations" item.
<br />
<br />
<img src="views/help/FileActionsDropdown.jpg" alt="file actions dropdown menu" style="max-height: 300px; max-width: 300px;">
<br />
<br />
Since this file has no metadata already associated with it, this is what you will see:
<br />
<br />
<img src="views/help/NoDataDescriptors.jpg" alt="metadata association page with no data descriptors" style="max-height: 700px; max-width: 700px;">
<br />
<br />
At the very top you can see the file that was selected.  If you selected multiple files
and picked the "Manage Annotations" items from the group action menu, you would see
all the chosen files listed there.  Below that is the section that would display any
data descriptors that are already association with the selected file(s).  Since there 
aren't any associations yet, it states there are no data descriptors for this file.
The final section shows existing data descriptors that you can clone (and edit) or 
just associate directly with your file(s).
<br />
<br />
A data descriptor is a basic description of your data.  The intent is to provide
the bare minimum level of information that would allow other researchers to 
find, understand, and trust your data. 
<br />
<br />
A file can have multiple data descriptors,
and each data descriptor can be associated with multiple files.  For example, 
say you did a well sampling trip, and each well result was a separate file.  
You might have one overall data descriptor that you associate with all the files, 
indicating the date(s) of the trip, the island, who took the samples, or anything else
that applies to all the data.  Then you might make different data descriptors
for each location describing the time of the sample, who was involved at that 
particular location, what was collected, the importance of that location,
or whatever else is unique to that set of files.
<br />
<br />
For this walkthrough, we will create a new data descriptor for our data.  
<br />
<br />
<img src="views/help/DataDescriptorNewV2.jpg" alt="data description creation" style="max-height: 1200px; max-width: 800px;">
<br />
<br />
Next to each label is a tooltip icon that tells you about the field when you click on it.  The first four values
are required.  For fields that ask for the names of people or organizations, you can either select from one of
the existing values or you can create your own.  To create a new person or organization, click on the "Add" button
below the field in which you wanted to be added.  For person, you will see this form:
<br />
<br />
<img src="views/help/CreatePerson.jpg" alt="person creation" style="max-height: 600px; max-width: 600px;">
<br />
<br />
For organization, you will see this form:
<br />
<br />
<img src="views/help/CreateOrganization.jpg" alt="org creation" style="max-height: 600px; max-width: 600px;">
<br />
<br />
Add some values to the form and click save.  The new record shows up as selected in
your form.  You can remove any entries by clicking the "x" button next to the entry you want to remove.
<br />
<br />
<img src="views/help/DDCreatorAdded.jpg" alt="creator added" style="max-height: 100px; max-width: 400px;">
<br />
<br />
When you are finished, click the "Save Data Descriptor" button at the bottom 
of the form.  The form will show a message that your data descriptor metadata 
has been saved and the new data descriptor will be shown as being associated
with your file:
<br />
<br />
<img src="views/help/DDSavedView.jpg" alt="data descriptor saved view" style="max-height: 800px; max-width: 800px;">
<br />
<br />
If you need to change any of the values after this, click the "Edit" button next
to your Data Descriptor.  This will reload the form you just filled in, 
pre-loaded with all your values.  
<br />
<br />
<img src="views/help/DDEdit.jpg" alt="data descriptor edit view" style="max-height: 1200px; max-width: 800px;">
<br />
<br />
Note that there are some new additions to the form that you didn't see when
you first created your Data Descriptor:  "Select Locations" and "Select Variables".
This is because the Data Descriptor needs to exist in the system before
other types of metadata can be associated with it.
<br />
<br />
To add existing Location or Variable metadata to your file, click on the 
"Select Locations" or "Select Variables" buttons in the Data Descriptor form.  
In each case, you will see something similar to this.
<br />
<br />
<img src="views/help/DDSelectLocations.jpg" alt="select locations" style="max-height: 800px; max-width: 800px;">
<br />
<br />
At the top of the form are search fields. In the lower half, there are existing 
metadata records that you can associate with your file by clicking "Associate" 
next to those that apply.   When you are finished, click the "Close" button and 
you will see all the associated records appear in the data descriptor form.
<br />
<br />
<img src="views/help/DDLocations.jpg" alt="locations selected" style="max-height: 300px; max-width: 400px;">
<br />
<br />
After saving your metadata, if you go back to your "My Data" page and look in the "status" column, you
will see the word "annotated" there.
<br />
<br />
<img src="views/help/Annotated.jpg" alt="file is annotated status" style="max-height: 200px; max-width: 800px;">
<br />
<br />
Once your files have sufficient metadata and you think it's ready for use by other members of the `IkeWai group,
you will need to go through the "Staging" process to make that happen.  This process lets the 
system administrators know that you have added the necessary metadata and ensured your file
is ready for group use.  The administrator will verify this and then publish your file to the 
repository.  To stage multiple files with one action, all files all need to be in the same directory.
Whether you want to stage a single file or multiple files, the process is the same.  
<br />
<br />
First, go to the My Data page 
and check the box on the left side next to each file you want to stage.  At the top of
the files section of the page, click on the "Actions" menu.
<br />
<br />
<img src="views/help/FileGroupActionsDropdown.jpg" alt="file group actions dropdown menu" style="max-height: 300px; max-width: 300px;">
<br />
<br />
Click the "Stage/Unstage For Repository" menu item.  When the page refreshes, all affected files should
now show as "staged" in the status column.  
<br />
<br />
<img src="views/help/Staged.jpg" alt="file is staged status" style="max-height: 200px; max-width: 800px;">
<br />
<br />
When each file is approved by the system administrator, the
status will change to "published." 
Should you later change your mind and decide the file is not ready
for staging, follow the exact same process to reverse the status and unstage the file.
<br />
<br />
If you want to share your file with someone who is not in the `IkeWai group,
you can generate a "Share Link" which will allow them to download the file
without requiring any form of login.  To do this, go to the "My Data" page.
Click the "Actions" menu next to the file you want to share and select 
"Create Share Link."  This modal will appear:
<br />
<br />
<img src="views/help/CreateShareLink.jpg" alt="create url to share file with others" style="max-height: 600px; max-width: 600px;">
<br />
<br />
The modal allows you to set the number of times the file can be downloaded and 
also lets you set an expiration date.  Once you set those, click the "Save"
button and the window changes to:
<br />
<br />
<img src="views/help/CreateShareLinkSaved.jpg" alt="save url to share file with others" style="max-height: 600px; max-width: 600px;">
<br />
<br />
You can use the buttons at the bottom to either email it to someone, or copy 
it to your clip board for however you want to use it.
<br />
<br />
To see all your share links, click on the "Share Links" tab in the sidebar.
<br />
<br />
<img src="views/help/ShareLinks.jpg" alt="show and manage all share links" style="max-height: 400px; max-width: 800px;">
<br />
<br />
All currently active share links will be listed here.  You can use the items
in the "Actions" menu next to each share link to email, copy, or delete each
share link.
<br />
<br />
<img src="views/help/ShareLinksActions.jpg" alt="actions menu for share links" style="max-height: 200px; max-width: 200px;">
<br />
<br />
