	<button class="accordion">How do I tag/associate metadata/data-descriptors to a user's files?</button>
	<div class="panel"><br />
		Go to the "Admin" menu item and select "Systems".
		Locate the directory of the user whose files you want to put into the repository, then select the "Actions->Browse"
		menu item to the right.  At this point, its as if you are the given user.  
		<br />
		Click on the "Actions" menu to the right of the target file.
		This brings up a dropdown menu with all file actions.
		<br />
		<img src="views/help/FileActionsDropdown.jpg" alt="file actions dropdown menu" style="max-height: 300px; max-width: 300px;">
		<br />
		Click on the "Annotate File" item.  Assuming you have never added any
		metadata to this file, you will see this:
		<br />
		<br />
		<img src="views/help/NoDataDescriptors.jpg" alt="metadata association page with no data descriptors" style="max-height: 700px; max-width: 700px;">
		<br />
		<br />
		At the very top you can see the file that was selected.  If you selected multiple files
		and picked the "Annotate File" items from the group action menu, you would see
		all the chosen files listed there.  Below that is the section that would display any
		data descriptors that are already association with the selected file(s).  Since there 
		aren't any associations yet, it states there are no data descriptors for this file.
		The final section shows existing data descriptors that you can clone (and edit) or 
		just associate directly with your file(s).
		<br />
		<br />
		A data descriptor is a basic description of your data.  The intent is to provide
		the bare minimum level of information that would allow other researchers to 
		find, understand, and trust your data. 
		<br />
		<br />
		A file can have multiple data descriptors,
		and each data descriptor can be associated with multiple files.  For example, 
		say you did a well sampling trip, and each well result was a separate file.  
		You might have one overall data descriptor that you associate with all the files, 
		indicating the date(s) of the trip, the island, who took the samples, or anything else
		that applies to all the data.  Then you might make different data descriptors
		for each location describing the time of the sample, who was involved at that 
		particular location, what was collected, the importance of that location,
		or whatever else is unique to that set of files.
		<br />
		<br />
		To create a new data descriptor for your data, click the "Create New Data Descriptor" button. 
		<br />
		<br />
		<img src="views/help/DataDescriptorNewV2.jpg" alt="data description creation" style="max-height: 1200px; max-width: 800px;">
		<br />
		<br />
		Next to each label is a tooltip icon that tells you about the field when you click on it.  The first four values
		are required.  For fields that ask for the names of people or organizations, you can either select from one of
		the existing values or you can create your own.  To create a new person or organization, click on the "Add" button
		below the field in which you wanted to be added.  For person, you will see this form:
		<br />
		<br />
		<img src="views/help/CreatePerson.jpg" alt="person creation" style="max-height: 600px; max-width: 600px;">
		<br />
		<br />
		For organization, you will see this form:
		<br />
		<br />
		<img src="views/help/CreateOrganization.jpg" alt="org creation" style="max-height: 600px; max-width: 600px;">
		<br />
		<br />
		Add some values to the form and click save.  The new record shows up as selected in
		your form.  You can remove any entries by clicking the "x" button next to the entry you want to remove.
		<br />
		<br />
		<img src="views/help/DDCreatorAdded.jpg" alt="creator added" style="max-height: 100px; max-width: 400px;">
		<br />
		<br />
		When you are finished, click the "Save Data Descriptor" button at the bottom 
		of the form.  The form will show a message that your data descriptor metadata 
		has been saved and the new data descriptor will be shown as being associated
		with your file:
		<br />
		<br />
		<img src="views/help/DDSavedView.jpg" alt="data descriptor saved view" style="max-height: 800px; max-width: 800px;">
		<br />
		<br />
		If you need to change any of the values after this, click the "Edit" button next
		to your Data Descriptor.  This will reload the form you just filled in, 
		pre-loaded with all your values.  
		<br />
		<br />
		<img src="views/help/DDEdit.jpg" alt="data descriptor edit view" style="max-height: 1200px; max-width: 800px;">
		<br />
		<br />
		Note that there are some new additions to the form that you didn't see when
		you first created your Data Descriptor:  "Select Locations" and "Select Variables".
		This is because the Data Descriptor needs to exist in the system before
		other types of metadata can be associated with it.
		<br />
		<br />
		To add existing Location or Variable metadata to your file, click on the 
		"Select Locations" or "Select Variables" buttons in the Data Descriptor form.  
		In each case, you will see something similar to this.
		<br />
		<br />
		<img src="views/help/DDSelectLocations.jpg" alt="select locations" style="max-height: 800px; max-width: 800px;">
		<br />
		<br />
		At the top of the form are search fields. In the lower half, there are existing 
		locations that you can associate with your file by clicking "Associate" 
		next to those that apply.   When you are finished, click the "Close" button and 
		you will see all the associated records appear in the data descriptor form.
		<br />
		<br />
		<img src="views/help/DDLocations.jpg" alt="locations selected" style="max-height: 300px; max-width: 400px;">
		<br />
		<br />
		After saving your metadata, if you go back to your "My Data" page and look in the "status" column, you
		will see the word "annotated" there.
		<br />
		<br />
		<img src="views/help/Annotated.jpg" alt="file is annotated status" style="max-height: 200px; max-width: 800px;">
		<br />
		<br />
		If you later decide other files should be associated with an existing data descriptor,
		select the "Annotate File" item from the Actions menu next to the file, then
		look through the Data Descriptors that are displayed at the bottom of the resulting
		page.  You can either make a copy of any of the data descriptors, or you can 
		click the "Associate" button next to one or more data descriptors.

	<button class="accordion">How do I get a user's file(s) into the repository for group viewing?</button>
	<div class="panel"><br />
		First, make sure the file has been annotated.  Don't push files that do not have sufficient metadata.
		Go to the "Admin" menu item and select "Systems".  
		Locate the directory of the user whose files you want to put into the repository, then select the "Actions->Browse"
		menu item to the right.  At this point, its as if you are the given user.  
		<br />
		<br />
		To stage a single file, select "Stage/Unstage" from the "Actions" menu to the right of the file.
		To stage multiple files with one action, all files all need to be in the same directory.
		Check the box on the left side next to each file you want to stage.  
		At the top of the files section of the page, click the "Actions" menu followed by "Stage/Unstage For Repository" menu item.  
		the word "Staged."
		<br />
		<br />
		Now that the file is staged, go to the "Admin->Staged Files" menu item in the main navigation.
		Find the appropriate file and click the "Publish" button.  The file is now in the Annotated Team Data repository.

	<button class="accordion">How do I create share links for public access of Gateway data?</button>
	<div class="panel"><br />
		There are two types of share links you can make, both of which require the file to be in the annotated repository.
		One of the links allows you to specify an expiration date or number of accesses, this is a "Share Link."
		The other is a "Public Link" which allows anyone who has the url to access the file without limit.
		For both of these, go to the "Annotated Team Data" menu item and find the file you want to share.
		To the right of the file, click the "Actions" menu, followed by either "Create Share Link" or "Create Public Link."
		The latter will create the link instantly and a "public link" link will appear next to the file on the page.
		The rest of these instructions are for "Share Links." Upon clicking the "Create Share Link" menu item,
	  This modal will appear:
		<br />
		<br />
		<img src="views/help/CreateShareLink.jpg" alt="create url to share file with others" style="max-height: 600px; max-width: 600px;">
		<br />
		<br />
		The modal allows you to set the number of times the file can be downloaded and 
		also lets you set an expiration date.  Once you set those, click the "Save"
		button and the window changes to:
		<br />
		<br />
		<img src="views/help/CreateShareLinkSaved.jpg" alt="save url to share file with others" style="max-height: 600px; max-width: 600px;">
		<br />
		<br />
		You can use the buttons at the bottom to either email it to someone, or copy 
		it to your clip board for however you want to use it.
		<br />
		<br />
		To see all your share links, click on the "Share Links" tab in the sidebar.
		<br />
		<br />
		<img src="views/help/ShareLinks.jpg" alt="show and manage all share links" style="max-height: 400px; max-width: 800px;">
		<br />
		<br />
		All currently active share links will be listed here.  You can use the items
		in the "Actions" menu next to each share link to email, copy, or delete each
		share link.
		<br />
		<br />

	<button class="accordion">How do I push a user's data to Hydroshare and ikewai.org?</button>
	<div class="panel"><br />
		Note that if data is pushed to Hydroshare, it will also automatically
		be pushed to the ikewai.org site.  The ability to push to ikewai.org or Hydroshare
		is not available until after the files have been in the Gateway's annotated repository.  The 
		menu items discussed here will not appear until then.
		<br />
		<br />
		<ol>
			<li>Verify the file is viewable in the annotated repository, if it isn't go through the process to push the files there before continuing with the following steps.</li>
			<li>Go to "Data Descriptors->All Data Descriptors" and find the data descriptor of the files you want pushed to Hydroshare.</li>
			<li>Click on the "Stage to Hydroshare" menu item in the "Actions" menu to the right of that data descriptor.</li>
      <li>On the resulting pop-up, make sure everything looks good and click the "Stage to Hydroshare" button.</li>
			<li>Go to "Admin->Staged Data Descriptors"</li>
      <li>Next to the correct data descriptor, click the "Actions" menu followed by the "Push to Hydroshare" menu item.</li>
			<li>At that point, log in to Hydroshare using the ikewai account and publish it</li>
      <li>Come back to the gateway and go to "Admin->Staged Data Descriptors"</li>
      <li>Next to the correct data descriptor, click the "Actions" menu followed by the "Get Hydroshare DOI" menu item.  At that point you are finished.  You can look at the data descriptor to see the Hydroshare DOI link as well as the public link to retrieve the associated files.</li>
		</ol>
